\section*{Conclusion}

The objective of the project was to optimize the fire simulation \gls{fds} using
\gls{hh}. Another goal was to contribute to the development of \gls{hh} by
optimizing a serialization library originally created for a project at ISIMA.\\

The port of \gls{fds} to \gls{hh} is not yet complete, as we concluded that this
task was too complicated to be achieved manually. Therefore, we eventually
decided to develop a tool that could automate a part of this process. However,
we are still in the early stages of this project and no implementation has been
done yet. Even if we stopped working directly on \gls{fds}, we have optimized
some parts of the simulation. This preliminary work was useful to understand how
the simulator works. Moreover, it had a significant impact on the specifications
of the tool that we want to make.\\

During the internship, it has been proposed to use the serialization library in
the cluster version of \gls{hh}. New features have been implemented, and
optimizations have been made to accelerate the serialization. The library offers
a unique concept and provides a lot of tools. Despite these optimizations, it
remains slightly slower than the other libraries on the market. However, it is
more flexible because it is not restricted to the types of the standard library,
and it is easily expandable. More optimization will be implemented in the future
to compete with the other libraries.\\

This internship was a good introduction to the world of \gls{hpc}. A lot of
knowledge has been acquired, and an innovative project have been initiated.
There are a lot of differences between the initial expectations and what was
done eventually. However, the work in a laboratory often differs from the work
in a company, as it is not always possible to predict the results when we start
working on a research project.
