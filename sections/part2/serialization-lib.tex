\section{Serialization library}

In this section, we will present the optimizations added to a serialization
library developed as a school project at ISIMA \cite{projectzz3isima}. The purpose
of these optimizations is to make this library usable in \gls{hpc} application.
In our context, the objective was to use this library to transfer datas between
nodes using MPI on the cluster version of \gls{hh}.

\subsection{The principle}

First, we are going to explain the principle of the library.

\subsection{Removing the streams}

todo: talk about the trial of splitting the list

\subsection{Redesigning the convertor}

\subsection{New features}

\subsection{Conclusion}
