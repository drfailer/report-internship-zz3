\section{Objectives}

The objective of the project is to use the \gls{hh} library to accelerate a
simulation application called \gls{fds}.

\gls{hh} is a \gls{hpc} library created at the NIST. It uses data-flow graphs to
express algorithms composed of tasks that can be ran asynchronously. This
library will be described in the section \ref{sec:hh}.

\gls{fds} is a simulation of fire also created at the NIST. The principle is to
simulation fire evolution given a certain configuration. The configuration is
given threw a file that will information such as the size of the room, the
walls, the windows and doors, the material on fire at the beginning, \dots

The \gls{fds}'s team has acquire a new computing cluster, however the current
program does not scale as expected when they increase the number of CPUs. Our
main objective will be to see if it is possible to improve the performances
using \gls{hh}.
