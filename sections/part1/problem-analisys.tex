\section{Problem analysis}

The first thing that will need to be done is understanding how to use \gls{hh}.
To do that, the easiest way is to follow the tutorials and create first programs
to explore the various features of the library. We will describe some of these
programs in this repport in order to present the \gls{hh}.

The next step will be to study \gls{fds}'s source code and isolate the
different parts that will be parallelized with \gls{hh}. \gls{fds} is written in
Fortran and some part of the code are already parallelized with either MPI or
OpenMP. The objective is not to rewrite the entire application in C++. Here, we
want to keep the original code and split it into different library that will be
used in the C++ code. Only a few critical algorithms will be entirely rewritten
in C++ in order to optimize the performances.
